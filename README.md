# bbfutsal_app
 Mobile application for futsal results and rankings.

 # secrets.json

 To be able to run this application properly, you'll need to setup a secrets.json file in the root folder that looks like this:

{
    "RankingEndpointKey":"",
    "ResultsEndpointKey":""
}

Add the values of your datascraper function endpoints and it should be fine!
